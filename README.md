## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

This is a pure front-end application. You can run it locally with any simple web server.

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/api-key-finder.git](https://github.com/your-username/api-key-finder.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd api-key-finder
    ```

3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. For full functionality (especially if you add features that require it), it's best to use a local server.

    * **Using VS Code's Live Server:** If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to launch a local development server with one click.
    * **Using Python's HTTP Server:** If you have Python installed, you can run a simple server from your terminal:
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! The easiest way to contribute is by adding new API guides to our database.

1.  **Open the `index.html` file.**
2.  **Locate the `apiDatabase` array** inside the `<script>` tag.
3.  **Add a new object** to the array for the API you want to add. Follow the existing structure:

    ```javascript
    { 
        name: 'Name of Service', 
        description: 'A brief description of what it does.', 
        authType: 'API Key / OAuth 2.0 / etc.', 
        link: 'Direct link to the API key page', 
        docs: 'Direct link to the main documentation page', 
        guide: [
            "First step of the guide.", 
            "Second step of the guide.", 
            "Third step."
        ], 
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'category'],
        codeSnippets: {
            python: `print("Hello, Python!")`,
            javascript: `console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");`
        }
    }
    ```
    *If there are no code snippets, you can set `codeSnippets: null`.*
